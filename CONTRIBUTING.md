# Contributing

Start from an issue in AllenYolk/pi-minimal-display. State the observable behavior and acceptance cases before changing runtime code. Keep one issue-sized change per branch and link its PR to the issue. Use the vocabulary in CONTEXT.md and read relevant decisions in docs/adr/.

Implement one tested behavior at a time. Tests exercise configuration loading, activation/disposal, observable native/compact rendering, and the real packaged CLI load. Avoid asserting private call counts or generating expected output from the implementation itself.

## Required checks

Run `npm run check` and, for rendering changes, `npm run benchmark` with the same Node/Pi/workload as the baseline. Record what was measured. The CLI probes need uv and Python 3.12; use `uv python install 3.12`.

CI runs the certified Pi version on Linux/macOS and Node 22.19.0/24.12.0. The upstream-version job detects release drift; it does not certify a new host. Widen certification only after real CLI, rendering, replay, expansion, errors, and repeated lifecycle checks pass on that exact version.

Independent review covers standards and the spec separately. Resolve release-blocking findings with regression evidence before marking a candidate ready. A green mocked test is not evidence of real-host compatibility.

## Release checklist

- Confirm the spec issue's acceptance criteria and record the exact reviewed commit.
- Complete type, behavior, real CLI lifecycle, package-load, and rendering-performance checks.
- Inspect `npm pack --json --ignore-scripts`: only source, README, LICENSE and package metadata belong in the tarball.
- Confirm the source entry exists without a local build; no install lifecycle scripts, credential reads, telemetry or bundled Pi core.
- Record tested platforms/versions, known limits, rollback instructions and independent-review outcomes.
- Obtain the owner's publication approval before `npm publish` or installing into their daily profile.

MIT contributions must have clear provenance. Do not copy compact-display source under an assumed license: its package metadata and LICENSE disagree.
